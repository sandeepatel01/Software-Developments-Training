# Workday Counter

---

You're planning a week's schedule and need to count the days you are working. You have an array where each element represents a day of the week. How can you calculate how many days you are working?

### Problem Statement:

Create a function that takes an array of days (e.g., `[ "Monday" , "Friday"]`) and "Tuesday" returns the number of days you're working. "Saturday" and "Sunday" are not working days.
