# Inverted Starry Mountain Pattern

---

You're on a camping trip with your friends, and you all want to set up a starry mountain as a symbol of your adventure. To make things more fun, you decide to use stars to draw an inverted mountain pattern. The challenge: print it so everyone can admire the majestic mountain shape!

### Problem Statement:

Create a function invertedMountain(n) that prints an inverted mountain made of stars.

The number n represents the number of stars at the top, and the pattern should reduce by one star each line until only one star is left at the bottom.

### Important Rules:

- Each line must not have trailing spaces.
- The output must not have an extra newline at the end.

For Example:

- For n= 4, the output will look like:

```
****
***
**
*
```
