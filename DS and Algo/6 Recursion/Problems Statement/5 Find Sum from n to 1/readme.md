# Find Sum from n to 1

Write a program that takes an integer N as input and calculates the sum of all numbers from N to 1.

### Input:

- A single integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 10⁶)

### Output:

- Print the sum of all numbers from N to 1.

```
Input: n = 5
Output: 15
```

```
Input: n = 10
Output: 55
```

### Explanation:

The sum of all numbers from 5 to 1 is 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 15.

The sum of all numbers from 10 to 1 is 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 55.
