# Find All Occurrences of Target in an Array

Given an array of integers arr of size n and an integer target, write a function to find all the indices where the target element appears in the array.

### Input:

- An integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10⁶) representing the size of the array.
- An array arr of size n containing integers (-10⁹ ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10⁹).
- An integer target representing the element to search for.

### Output:

- Return an array containing all the indices where target appears in arr. If the target is not found, return an empty array.

### Example 1:

```
Input:
n = 6
arr = [1, 3, 7, 3, 9, 3]
target = 3

Output: [1, 3, 5]
```

### Example 2:

```
Input:
n = 5
arr = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
target = 5

Output: []
```
