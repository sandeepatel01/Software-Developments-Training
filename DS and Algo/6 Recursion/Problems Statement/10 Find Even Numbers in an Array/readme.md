# Find Even Numbers in an Array

Given an array of integers arr of size n, write a function to find all the even numbers present in the array.

### Input:

- An integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10⁶) representing the size of the array.
- An array arr of size n containing integers (-10⁹ ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10⁹).

### Output:

- Return an array containing all even numbers from the input array in the same order. If no even numbers are found, return an empty array.

### Example 1:

```
Input:
n = 6
arr = [3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 13]

Output:
[4, 8, 10]
```

### Example 2:

```
Input:
n = 4
arr = [1, 3, 5, 7]

Output:
[]
```
