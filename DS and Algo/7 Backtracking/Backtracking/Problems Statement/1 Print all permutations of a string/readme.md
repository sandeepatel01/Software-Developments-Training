# Print all permutations of a string.

Given a string S, print all possible permutations (arrangements) of its characters. A permutation of a string is a rearrangement of its characters into a different sequence.

### Input:

- A string S of length N (1 ≤ N ≤ 10), consisting of lowercase English letters.

### Output:

- Print each permutation on a new line.
- The order of permutations does not matter.

### Example 1:

```
Input:
abc

Output:
abc
acb
bac
bca
cab
cba
```

### Example 2:

```
Input:
aa

Output:
aa
```

### Constraints:

- The input string may contain duplicate characters.
- The output should contain only unique permutations.
