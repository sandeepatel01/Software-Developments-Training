## Backtracking

Backtracking is an algorithmic technique that uses recursion and systematically explores possible solutions.

Ye tab use hoti hai jab multiple choices ho aur hume ek ya zyada valid solutions dhoondhne ho.

### Concept of Backtracking

- Make a decision.
- If the decision is correct, move forward.
- If it is wrong, go back (backtrack) and try other options.
- Continue this process until a solution is found or all possibilities are exhausted.
